###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2366,1572360722.0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

1jkfz8c,"Life finally broke me, depression ftw","The last 2 years has been rough, had a house fire, lost everything, worked a lot of doubles while couch surfing to regain everything, met a girl, she was abusive & controlling, isolated me from everyone, so I now have no friends, she cheated on me & stole everything out of my apartment, police did nothing. Lost my job because of her, I moved in with my grandfather not long after and started trying to rebuild my life. 

Everything was going alright until, a few days ago, we were out grocery shopping. While I was paying for the groceries, my Gramps walked out of the store to sit on the bench outside to wait for me because he had breathing problems and couldn't stand for long periods of time. As I came out of the store, I saw him getting attacked and robbed by a group of guys I don't remember how many. All I remember in that moment is just rushing in, no matter how many times I got knocked down I quickly stood up and shielded him from every attack. I probably could've taken out some of them if I fought back but I didn't want to risk moving from my position and my grandfather getting hurt so I just tanked the hits. Someone called the police and the attackers took off. I ended up blacking out for a bit, woke up with a broken nose, a few fractures in my face & news that the whole situation caused my grandfather to have a heart attack and die. 

My fractures were a little more severe than the doctor originally thought, so I was rushed to the trauma unit in another city almost an hour away because the hospital in my town is a none surgical hospital. Been here a few days. A police report was made and they're looking for the suspects. I have no faith in the police. Early this morning I got a call from my boss saying I'm fired. Even though I explained what happened, he didn't seem to care. Now I'm in the hospital healing, about to be homeless when I get out. Idk how long an enviction notice gives me but it'll be like a week or less until rent is due again and I'm trying to get discharged early to hopefully get bacl to my grandfather's apartment to grab what little clothes and stuff I have left and try to figure out my next move. With less than 36 and change to my name, no vehicle, no family, no friends and yhe coroner keeps asking what I want to do with the body, what funeral home, and all that sort of stuff. He didn't have life insurance, or a will, or anything in savings.

 I keep saying idk because I don't know because I just dont. I don't understand how to handle this, I never had to handle this. I feel stupid. Everyone expects me to have this whole situation magically under control, but I don't, I feel like a child. I'm so lost, I'm on my own. I understand I'm an adult, and I should just man up & just deal with it. But I'm so emotionally numb right now. I try so hard to be a good person. I just don't understand why bad things keep happening. I can't seem to catch a break. I feel so broken that I can't even bring myself to cry over my grandfather's death for some reason. Does that make me a horrible person?  I know I should be freaking out about my financial situations and what's going to happen to me after I leave the hospital, but I'm oddly calm, and idk why. I apologize for the long post, I don't expect anyone to care or to even read all of this. I just needed to get my feelings out because there's no one else I can talk to rn.

I've had a not very pleasant life, dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 13 and depression since I was 17 (last year of high school). I manage to graduate from high school, but after that it went downhill. Did 2 years of college, but I had to stop because I was getting burned out, and I had to miss 2 weeks of classes because of a medical emergency and after that did not have the motivation to catch up.

After that I had one year of doing nothing at home waiting for another college to start. I had therapy twice a week to try and get better, but it didn't work. So I started my second college depressed, it was hard but ok, I even managed to make some friend and continued going to therapy, I tried so hard to get better, but I struggle to do all the coursework. In my third year I felt depression creeping up over me even harder, I stopped seeing my college friends and stopped doing my coursework, so I had to leave.

Two years has passed since. I never talked to my college friends again and never told them I failed. I never told my other friends I failed. I either stopped talking to them or lied to them because I'm too ashamed. I spent these two years as a NEET (I never left my mom's house) but I didn't give up, and I kept going to therapy and do some activities, like board game nights, hobbies etc. but i still feel terrible. I struggle more to do these activities and I spend my day on youtube, reddit or playing video games while sometimes practicing my other hobbies, but I often don't have the motivation.

Since last month, it's gotten worse, I don't want to do anything, I hate that I failed college and I miss my friends, I hate that I lied to them. I tried so many times to heal, but the depression never went away. Now I'm a 25yo with no education, no job, no experience, no drive, no skills and no talents

I’m in therapy, I’m taking meds, I’m even on an antipsychotic. But one thing that has been triggering my OCD and depression is a tattoo on my bicep. It was so cute when I got it 8 years ago. Now years have passed and it looks like shit because it’s warped

I tried a touchup and it still looks bad. For the last three months, every single day I think about it all day every day. I’ve been to removal clinics and they won’t take me because it’s colorful and I’m biracial so apparently I’m just not a good candidate 

Some artists are saying they can cover it but it’s just so colorful and saturated and on such a sensitive spot, it already even has a small scar; I just don’t see it working out in any way for me. And it’s making me super suicidal bc I don’t have any other plausible solutions

Nothing is comforting except sleep. My bf says its fine, my friends say who cares, my grandma even said its fine. None of it comforts me. I feel like I’ve ruined my body and life and there’s nothing I can do to change it

Working? I’m probably going to get fired as this has rendered me non-functional and all I do at work is cry. But since I’m the breadwinner I feel like I need to somehow keep going

Anyways this is probably a first world problem but truly I feel like my life is totally over and I don’t wanna live anymore ",16,1742991477.0,"Suicidal over my tattoo(s) tw/ suicidal ideation

1jkeql2,MY WHOLE LIFE SUCKS AND IS RUINED BY ME,"So iam 18(M) and  iam a huge looser in everything.
I failed in academics , social, life love , family everything.
I was below average student till grade 10 still choose math for higher studies, I was just full of myself and doesn't know how things work my parents made me take admission in very expensive tution and I did home schooling for 11th and 12th grade.
I didn't study at all I was so lazy to do so, literally spent all my time scrolling or using mobile.well then what can you expect
I failed in my 12th grade, I failed in math and physics , I went from preparing for a high level college entrance exam in such expensive tution to failing 12th.
I still gave a college entrance exam I got the results and it was not even 15 percentile.
I was so scared I lied to everyone in my family that I scored 90+ percentile even edited my result and show them the fake one and they still believe it.
That way I was saved last year saying that I forgot to focus on school exams cuz of college entrance exam.
But become I failed 12th grade i had to repeat 12th again and I did.
 now coming back to present after 1 year I gave my final 12th exam yesterday of math and iam 100% sure that I will not get above 70% I did the same mistake as last year. And most imp thing is to get addmission in college in my country you need minimum of 75% in your 12th this means I cannot enter in any good colleges.
While everyone in my family and relatives are thinking that iam sure to get 90% in my 12th result.
Now I have a college entrance exam on 4 April and I have zero preparation for it same as past year.
Iam so scared I can't even describe , I cry everyday thinking how much iam gonna disappoint my parents when my result will come out.
If only I didn't choose to select such hard subjects or not decided to go tution and home schooling instead of just living a normal student life everything might have better.
In the spam of last 3 years I haven't gone anywhere to travel didn't made a single friend, didn't even went out from my house. Everyone in my friend group is doing smthg or is in college iam the only one who is nowhere.
Everytime I see their stories the things they have what they are doing in life it makes me so fucking jeolous.
Some days ago my cousin came who is around 10 , he made a joke about me failing 12th , one of my cousin told me that his mom told them ""study or you will end up like your big brother, a failure"" it literally just break me.
I have no idea what iam gonna do with my life.
I have no future, no friends no one, I never even talked to girl In real life i have a big social enxiety. My looks are even worse I look like shit. 
I was in a online relationship with a girl and it didn't even last a month, I was so insecure that I didn't even showed her my face.
Just heard some days ago that she has a new boyfriend now.
I just feel so useless.
There are so many more stuffs but iam sure you just gonna get bored reading that.

Rn I have entrance exam on 4 April, well iam faking that iam sick and gonna skip the exam.
As For my 12th if I didn't score 75% i will give  a improvement exam to increase my marks.
And will take a drop year to prepare for college exams.

But what iam scared of is what everyone gonna think of me , iam so scared of people judging me to the point I just act like the way they want me to , so they don't think bad of me. I feel like iam just trapped cannot figure out what I really am.
another thing I lie often, almost about everything almost everyone who knows me , they don't know me at all becouse everything I told them abt me is lie. I just feel so ashamed of myself abt everything.
I even scared rn that everyone here gonna judge me for this.
Just posting this cuz I don't know what to do maybe I feel better after that.
I am gonna kms soon anyways. ",8,1743003594.0,"MY WHOLE LIFE SUCKS AND IS RUINED BY ME So iam 18(M) and  iam a huge looser in everything.

I am just trying to be a better person and husband. I apologize in advance for any spelling errors or weirdly worded sentences I’m trying but it’s really hard to get my thoughts on paper.

My family is pretty messed most of them are either on drugs or on the news for selling them/hurting people. Most of the men in my family are in gangs including my father and he was there when I was jumped in that was the most proud I ever seen him. I was in foster care for a while and then adopted when I was 9/10 to a terrible family who treated me and the other kids they adopted like house slaves… I’m talking every door in the house locked,pantry locked .some of the adopted kids wernt even allowed to to eat at the same time as the family. I left there when I was 16 and got emancipated shortly after. I am not alone I found a friend and over time he became my brother and his mom took me in as her own calls me son shows me off on Facebook with her other kids she loves me. I have people in my corner they are just not sure how to help and I’m not even sure how to help myself or where to begin honestly I’m hoping a lot of people see this and are able to toss some suggestions my way.

This is What is happening 

I can’t focus on multiple things I can’t multi task I end up forgetting steps or forgetting a task all together 

I can’t keep up with responsibilities or bills because my focus can only be on one thing 

I am feeling so frustrated and irritated all the time now very little happy moments 

I’ve only been eating one meal a day for about 2 or 3 months now losing my hunger for food I only eat when my stomach starts to hurt 

Getting out of bed in the mornings is a losing battle every time I’m late to work damn near everyday 

I feel like I’ve been declining and now one can help me and it won’t get better I was hopeful in the beginning that I would feel better I no longer have that hope I hate everyday 

All I wanna do is lay in bed and sleep all day but I can’t sleep even tho I’m exhausted I’m exhausted everyday even after waking up from a lot off sleep

I am randomly super anxious at random points in the day and I’m not sure what brings on such a heavy unsettling feeling like something is wrong 

Remembering to take medication or remembering I have an appointment is damn near impossible I forget as soon as I’m told 

My procrastination has gotten so bad I will save something intill the absolute last second and then be extremely upset that I am feeling rushed

1jkqvmt,"Parents were abusive, SA'd from 3 years old, 4 bfs died, son died, current bf is hiding other women, harassment at work and now out of a job. What's the point anymore?","Throw away acct for privacy.
 

My mother was physically and verbally abusive and let men into our home who would take advantage of me. I remember things from 3 years old that I would rather not discuss. This went on until I left at 16. She used to beat my brother and I so bad we couldn't walk and she would sometimes make us stay home from school so she wouldn't be found out. My dad wasn't around, mostly, but when he was forced to see me, he told me he hated me being around him and his new family because I'd corrupt them.


 As I said, I left home at 16, and I moved in with my boyfriend and his mother and her boyfriend. His mother and her boyfriend were crackheads and regularly brought trouble to the house. One time she owed money to a drug dealer and a group of huge men with guns came to the house, took her to ""work off her debts"" and kept us hostage in the house until she was done. For days we had no food and were afraid to leave. His mother was a diagnosed schizophrenic on top of the drug use and would regularly hallucinate. She threatened to kill me on multiple occasions and chased me out of the house with a butcher knife. 


I never really picked the best boyfriends when I got older either, probably due to unresolved trauma, though I've attempted therapy many times. I've dated abusive men, either physically or emotionally, no matter how hard I've tried to choose better. Thankfully I've had enough sense not to marry any of them. 


One boyfriend took me to a big city to meet and hang out with some of his old friends. While we were there he got arrested for outstanding warrants I didn't know about. I was left at his friend's house where I ended up being drugged and raped. I managed to trick the man into thinking I was going to the bathroom and escaped the house. I wandered around the city I didn't know, dazed and no one would help me. I finally found a hospital and called a friend. 


I got pregnant at 19 with my first son, and two years later had a second boy. My second son had unexplained health issues that kept us in and out of the hospital for the entire 16 months of his life. They never figured out what was wrong with him. Shortly after, the father of my 2 sons passed away from diabetic complications. 


The next bf hung himself, the next died from a drug overdose, and the last died from drinking too much. These were not one after the other, just throughout my life, and some of them were exes at the time they passed, but still people I cared about. 


I went to school for on and off for 6 years but have no degrees. Due to life, I was never able to finish any program fully, though I did learn a lot. And racked up a disgusting amount of student debt that I will undoubtedly still owe on even after I die. I have 4 children and suffered 4 devastating, late term miscarriages. I try so hard every day to be a good person and good mother. I don't do drugs besides occasional weed to calm my nerves and I do have a few drinks on the weekends, but I stay home and don't party or get wasted. 


I had a well paying job, around $80k/year with great benefits, but I was being sexually and otherwise harassed. I tried to fight it, but ended up making things worse for myself. I can't go back to that profession for reasons I can't explain without possibly exposing my identity or the company. I've been unemployed since October of 2024 and I have no idea what to do with myself. Work or otherwise.
 

I am now in my 40s and experiencing perimenopause and have gained 70lbs and continue to gain despite changing my diet and walking up to 30,000 steps some days. I can't fit in any of my clothing and hate looking at myself in a mirror. I cry about it daily. I've gotten to point of being embarrassed to be in public or be seen by friends and family. I've let my hygiene slip because who cares? Most times I live in sweats and don't even want to get out of bed. 


My current boyfriend has been hiding conversations with another woman, possibly more. I only caught him once, but suspect there is more I don't know, either with the same woman or others. I'm sure it has everything to do with my depression, my weight gain, and my lack of hygiene, on top of the total loss in libido. I've seen the women he looks at on his phone or the ones he sneaks peeks at in public. There's no way he's even remotely attracted to me anymore. But I feel like the one trapped. I have my youngest son with him and he is a toddler. My bf of course pays for everything at this point, so I put up with his indiscretions because what else can I do? I've applied at other jobs for months, and there is just nothing that will pay enough to support myself and my children, or they are looking elsewhere, or they went a different direction, or whatever the plethora of reasons are.  


I know there are other people out there that have it worse than me, so I feel bad complaining, but I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like the best thing for everyone would be if I was gone. My children have a great dad, despite his disrespect for me, and aside from the initial sadness they might feel, I just don't think my presence here is worth the effort anymore. I'm tired.
